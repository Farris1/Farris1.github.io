              Some One asked me yesterday if <strong> "Software Developering" </strong> is a good job. So i've come here to give you the an
              answer; it is a good job since you get paid a lot; around about Â£100,000 pounds. This depends if you are a beginner programmer.
              If your child wants to become a programming of any sort i  think you should go to <em> Mimo: Learn to Code <em>In my Opinion i think
                 <a href="https://getmimo.com">Mimo</a> is a good way to learn and become a computer scientist giving you millions of courses.To Learn
                 From: Different languages; Different Topics / Subjects and you can also earn certificates.
              </p>
              <p>
              When I found out about <em>Mimo: Learn to code</em> it really helped me alot so i really recommend trying out

                         I was building a website the other day and thought about the breaking tag < br >. Many web
                         developers i work with still get stuck with this. So i've come here to give you more information.
                         the Breaking tag is a empty tag so this means it doesn't have a closing tag; the Header tag has a closing tag;
                         its not empty: < / h3 > but braking line is emty: < br> .
                         </p>
